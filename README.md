## Introduction  
The purpose of this project is to classify hotel booking cancellations using historical booking data. The goal is to develop machine learning models that accurately predict whether a reservation will be canceled based on factors like lead time, booking source, deposit type, and guest behavior. These predictions can help hotels improve resource planning, reduce revenue loss, and optimize overbooking strategies.
